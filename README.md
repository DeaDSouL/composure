# Composure: don't fear the UNIX chainsaw

    > Don't just operate, create.

## What's included:

 * name()    : create function from last command
 * write()   : write out definition of a function
 * r [<str>] : redo last command, or last command matching <str>
 * sl        : sudo last command
 * Ctrl-j    : 'jump' from prompt into $EDITOR

## Installing

I like to keep configuration source files in my ~/conf directory. You'll likely
have a different preference. That's okay, just put composure.sh where you'd
like it to live and execute it. It will install itself automatically.
